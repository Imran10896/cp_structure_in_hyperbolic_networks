## Paper titled  " Uncovering the hidden core-periphery structure in hyperbolic networks" 


** cp_centralization** Calculate the core periphery centralization(cp-centralization) of a graph.
** statistical_test** Calculate the p-value for the cp-centralization of the given graph.

** generateS1Model.m this following matlab function, which uses the other function hyperbolic_dist_2D code for the network generation corresponding to the S1/H2 model.
    
    
**  For the network generation corresponding to the PSO Model and the visualisation of the figure 1, in this Mnauscript, we used the publically availble githhub reprository , we provided the Link below

######  https://github.com/biomedical-cybernetics ::: This reprository has a subreprository named as "nPSO_model (MATLAB code for the nonuniform PSO (nPSO) model) 
###### And the it also has the second subreprository named as "coalescent_embedding" which has subfolder named as "visualization_and_evaluation" was used for the generation of the figure 1 in the Manuscript.
