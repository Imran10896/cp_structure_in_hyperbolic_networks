# Core-Periphery Structure in Hyperbolic Networks

## This code is for the paper titled "Uncovering the Hidden Core-Periphery Structure in Hyperbolic Networks"

### Functions

- **cp_centralization**: Calculates the core-periphery centralization (cp-centralization) of a graph.
- **statistical_test**: Calculates the p-value for the cp-centralization of the given graph.
- **generateS1Model.m**: A MATLAB function that uses the `hyperbolic_dist_2D` code for network generation corresponding to the S1/H2 model.

**  For the network generation corresponding to the PSO Model and the visualisation of the figure 1, in this Mnauscript, we used the publically availble githhub reprository , we provided the Link below

######  https://github.com/biomedical-cybernetics ::: This reprository has a subreprository named as "nPSO_model (MATLAB code for the nonuniform PSO (nPSO) model) 
###### And the it also has the second subreprository named as "coalescent_embedding" which has subfolder named as "visualization_and_evaluation" was used for the generation of the figure 1 in the Manuscript.
