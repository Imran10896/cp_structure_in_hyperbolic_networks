# Core-Periphery Structure in Hyperbolic Networks

## Paper: "Uncovering the Hidden Core-Periphery Structure in Hyperbolic Networks"

### Functions

- **cp_centralization**: Calculates the core-periphery centralization (cp-centralization) of a graph.
- **statistical_test**: Calculates the p-value for the cp-centralization of the given graph.
- **generateS1Model.m**: A MATLAB function that uses the `hyperbolic_dist_2D` code for network generation corresponding to the S1/H2 model.

### Network Generation and Visualization

For the network generation corresponding to the PSO Model and the visualization of Figure 1 in the manuscript, we used a publicly available GitHub repository.

- [biomedical-cybernetics](https://github.com/biomedical-cybernetics): This repository contains:
  - **nPSO_model**: MATLAB code for the nonuniform PSO (nPSO) model.
  - **coalescent_embedding**: Contains a subfolder named "visualization_and_evaluation," which was used for generating Figure 1 in the manuscript.
